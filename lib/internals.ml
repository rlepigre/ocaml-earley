   (** Type of an active element of the earley table. In a description of
       earley, each table element is [(start, end, done * rest)] meaning we
       parsed the string from [start] to [end] with the rule [done] and it
       remains to parse [rest]. The [*] therefore denotes the current
       position. Earley is basically a dynamic algorithm producing all
       possible elements.

       We depart from this representation in two ways:

       - we do not represent [done], we keep the whole whole rule:
         [full = done rest]

       - we never keep [end]. It is only used when we finish parsing of a
         rule and we have an element [(start, end, done * Empty)] then, we
         look for other elements of the form [(start', end', done' * rest')]
         where [end' = start], [rest' = nonterm' rest''] and [nonterm'] is a
         non terminal containing the [done] rule. We represent this situation
         by a stack in the element [(start, end, done * Empty)], which is
         maintained to lists all the elements satisfying the above property
         (no more, no less, each element only once)

         The type ['a final] represent an element of the earley table
         where [end] is the current position in the string being parsed.

   (** Type of the element that appears in stacks. Note: all other
       elements no reachable from stacks will be collected by the GC,
       which is what we want to release memory.

       The type is similar to the previous: [('a, 'r) element], means
       that from a value of type 'a, comming from our parent in the
       stack, we could produce a value of type ['r] using [rest].

       The action needs to be prametrised by the future position which
       is unknown.  *)

           ; full  : 'c rule
           } -> ('a ,'r) element
     (** Cons cell of the stack with a record similar to D's *)

   (** Stack themselves are an acyclic graph of elements (sharing is
       important to be preserved). We need a reference for the stack
       construction.  *)
   and ('a,'b) stack = ('a,'b) element list ref

  (** For the construction of the stack, all elements of the same list
      ref of type ('a,'b) stack have the same en position [end'].  And
      all elements that points to this stack have their begin position
      [start = end']. Moreover, all elements with the same [full] and
      [start] must point to the same stack.  Recall that [end] is not
      represented in elements.

      We call the position [end'] associated to a stack (as said the
      [start] of the element that point to this stack, the "stack
      position". An important point: new stack elements are
      constructed when the stack position is the current position.

      Moreover, when we add a point from an element [(start, end, rest, full)]
      to a stack (which is therefore at position [start], we have
      [start = end] and [rest = full]. The rule has not parsed anything! This
      is the "prediction" phase of earley.

      To do this construction, we use the record below with a hook
      that we run on all elements added to that stack.  This record is
      only used with stack whose position are the current position: all
      these records will become inaccessible when we advance in
      parsing.

      Morevoer, a direct pointer (thanks to the Container module) is
      kept from the [full] rule of all elements that point to these
      stack and that have the current position as [end].  This is the
      role of the functor call below.  *)

  (** stack in construction ... they have a hook, to run on
      elements added to the stack later ! *)

     ; mutable hooks : (('a, 'b) element -> unit) list }

(** Recall the INVARIANTS:

1Â° Consider two C elements (or two D elements) of a stack.  If their
   have the same start and full is means we can to the same after
   a complete parsing of the rule.

   Then, the two elements MUST HAVE PHYSICALLY EQUAL stack

2Â° For D nodes, we keep only one for each (start, rest, full) triple
   with a merge warning when a node only differs by its actions
   (compared looking inside closure).

   So D nodes with the same (start, rest, full) triple always have
   equal action. This propagates to each stack (C node with the same
   (start, rest, full) in the same stack have phisically equal actions.
